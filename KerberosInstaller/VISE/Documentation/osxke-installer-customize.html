  <h1>Mac OS X Kerberos Extras Installer Customization Requirements &amp; 
    Tips </h1>
</center>
		
<h2>Overview</h2>
		
<p>In general, you may modify the Mac OS X Kerberos Extras Installer source 
  to suit the needs of your site. The binaries are provided in the layout the installer expects;
  all you need to do is replace the edu.mit.Kerberos file (and possibly the Read Me file) and
  rebuild the installer!  However, there are a few elements which all 
  installers must contain, and we have a few tips on customizing.</p>
		
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Your installer must display the &quot;Kerberos License&quot; file on startup 
    (this file is included with the distribution).
  <li>You should not change the install locations of Kerberos for Macintosh files, 
    simply because Kerberos for Macintosh will probably stop working if the 
    files are installed in different locations.
  <li>The MIT KfM OS X Extras Read Me is provided as a guideline for creating your own 
    read me. If you use a modified form of the Read Me, be sure to remove all 
    references to MIT support addresses - MIT's HelpDesk does 
    not provide support for Kerberos users outside of the MIT community.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Don't forget to update the <CODE>edu.mit.Kerberos</CODE> 
    file with appropriate realm configuration for your site before building the 
    installer! For details about how to do this, see the <a href="../../Documentation/preferences-osx.html">Kerberos 
    Preferences on Mac OS X Documentation</a>.</li>
  <li>Place your edited <CODE>edu.mit.Kerberos</CODE> file in <CODE>BinariesForInstaller</CODE> , replacing
    the MIT one that is provided as an example.
</ul>
