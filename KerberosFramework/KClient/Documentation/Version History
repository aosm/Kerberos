KClient 1.7.6
Oct 28, 1997

The story of KClient 1.7.6:

In October 1997, KClient development is done mostly at Dartmouth. They are
responsible for all additions from 1.6.2 to 1.7.6: KClient menu,
login floater, keystroke scrambling, ticket life preference, better error
reporting. At that time, 1.6.2 is the public version of KClient, and MIT
receives 1.7.6b3 sources from Dartmouth.

On October 28 1997, those sources are imported in MIT CVS repository. The
binary included with those sources is hacked to change the version number
to 1.7.6 and to contain MIT default preferences, and released internally
in MIT I/S as 1.7.6.

In December 1997, Apple releases Apple Data Detectors which conflict with
KClient 1.6.2 (the only available version)

In January 1998, Scott McGuire noticed that using KClient menu in 1.7.6b3
purges custom items from help menu in MacZephyr

On February 15 1998, a CWCVS bug related to KClient prompts rebuilding 
KClient from 1.7.6b3 sources for the first time. This is when we notice
that the sources actually build KClient 1.7.6b1.

On February 17 1998, the CWCVS bug and the help menu bug are fixed. After
brief negotiations with Gavin at UMich, who is doing most of KClient
development at the time, we decide to bump version number to 1.7.7b1.

Because of all of that stuff, we don't really have detailed version history
for this time; however, the following approximate reality reasonably well:

New features in this revision:
 - KClient menu
 - Login floaters
 - Keystroke scrambling in login dialog
 - Ticket lifetime preference
 - Better error reporting
 - Dartmouth Name Directory support

Bugs fixed in this revision:
 - Conflict between KClient and Apple Data Detectors resolved
 
Other changes in this revision: unknown.
