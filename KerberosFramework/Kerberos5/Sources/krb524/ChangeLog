	itself.

2001-09-28  Danilo Almeida  <dalmeida@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Add KRB524_STATIC_HACK for Windows build so that we
	can generate a k524init binary that has an static copy of the krb5

	* cnv_tkt_skey.c (krb524_convert_tkt_skey): Call krb_cr_tkt_krb5
	if necessary, depending on th enctype.  Force enctype to be raw
	DES3 if it's another DES3 type.

	* krb524d.c (kdc_get_server_key): Add integer kvno argument,
 	rename previous kvno arg as kvnop, to distinguish returned (found)
	kvno from the input kvno.
	(lookup_service_key): Add kvnop argument to allow for returned
	kvno.
	(do_connection): Search for DES3 keys as well as DES.  Get the

	a realm other than the default one.

Wed Jun 17 16:35:37 1998  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* cnv_tkt_skey.c (krb524_convert_tkt_skey): Handle null address

	generate the ticket address rather than just checking against it.

	* conv_creds.c (krb524_convert_creds_plain): Punt address checks.

1998-05-06  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* k524init.c (main): POSIX states that getopt returns -1

	* krb524d.c:
	* misc.c:
	* test.c: Don't include netdb.h or sys/socket.h if krb.h is
	included; this works around an Ultrix bug where those headers
	aren't protected against multiple inclusion.

Mon Aug 18 13:02:31 1997  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* configure.in: Add AC_PROG_INSTALL as we do install here.

	doesn't exist anymore.

	* conv_creds.c: Clean up substantially to be less convoluted.

	server; loop over the whole list before increasing the timeout.

	* configure.in: Update to use the new library build system to
	build libkrb524.

	* Makefile.in: Update to reflect changes in the library.  Also,
	use the new library build system to build libkrb524.

Thu Aug  7 17:34:59 1997  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* cnv_tkt_skey.c:

Thu Dec  5 23:12:29 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* cnv_tkt_skey.c (krb524_convert_tkt_skey): Change the issue time
		of the V4 ticket to be the current time (since the
		lifetime of the V4 ticket was calculated assuming that the
		issue time would be the current time).  [PR#283,PR#22]

Mon Nov 11 16:23:32 1996  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* krb524d.c (do_connection): only free v4/v5 keyblock contents and
	v5 ticket *once*, in cleanup branch at the end.

Thu Nov  7 15:45:16 1996  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* test.c (main): 
	* krb524d.c (main): 
	* k524init.c (main): 
	* getcred.c (main): Check the error return from
 		krb5_init_context(), and print an error message if
 		necessary.

Wed Jul 24 02:18:02 1996  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@mit.edu>

	* test.c (krb4_print_ticket): s/KRB4_INT4/krb5_ui_4 so we work
 	with Athena Kerberos4.

Wed Jul 24 01:14:27 1996  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tertius.mit.edu>

	* encode.c: s/PROTOTYPE/KRB5_PROTOTYPE

	* krb524.h (KRB5_PROTOTYPE): Use KRB5_PROTOTYPE not PROTOTYPE because the include file is installed and PROTOTYPE wasn't defined anyway. 

Wed Jul 31 17:05:25 1996  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* krb524d.c: Revert prior change due to shuffling of netdb.h

Tue Jul 30 19:58:22 1996  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

		kadm5/admin.h)

Fri Jul 19 20:22:47 1996  Marc Horowitz  <marc@mit.edu>

	* configure.in: added AC_PROG_AWK and USE_GSSAPI_LIBRARY

Tue Jul  9 16:14:33 1996  Barry Jaspan  <bjaspan@mit.edu>

Tue Jul  9 07:16:39 1996  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* test.c (krb4_print_ticket): Change addr to unsigned KRB4_32 from
		long. 

	* conv_creds.c (krb524_convert_creds_plain): Change addr to a four
		byte unsigned integer (from long).

Thu Jun 13 22:10:30 1996  Tom Yu  <tlyu@voltage-multiplier.mit.edu>

	* configure.in: remove ref to ET_RULES

Mon May  6 12:09:44 1996  Richard Basch  <basch@lehman.com>

	* conv_creds.c: Fallback to slave kdc's wasn't working; it was not
		handling the error code KRB524_NOTRESP as an indicator that
		the kdc is unreachable.

Sun Mar 31 01:17:26 1996  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* cnv_tkt_skey.c (krb524_convert_tkt_skey): use context->clockskew
	in all time bound checks.

	* cnv_tkt_skey.c (krb524_convert_tkt_skey): for time periods that
	would occupy greater than 128 ticks, use the CMU algorithm, based
	on the table cmu_seconds. (In conjunction with the previous
	changes, even non-CMU clients can be used for the full lifetime of
	a V5 ticket by rerunning krb524init when their lower
	interpretation of the end time is expired.)

	* cnv_tkt_skey.c (krb524_convert_tkt_skey): rather than apply fit
 	an extended v5 lifetime into a v4 range, give out a v4 ticket with
 	as much of the v5 lifetime is available "now" instead.

Tue Mar 19 17:07:44 1996  Richard Basch  <basch@lehman.com>

	* conv_creds.c (krb524_convert_creds_plain):
	if the v5 lifetime is greater than the max v4 lifetime, use the max
	v4 lifetime (0xff), rather than masking it with 0xff.

Fri Jan 12 04:37:23 1996  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* cnv_tkt_skey.c (krb524_convert_tkt_skey): rather than apply fit
 	an extended v5 lifetime into a v4 range, give out a v4 ticket with
 	as much of the v5 lifetime is available "now" instead.

Sat Jan 27 01:31:12 1996  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tertius.mit.edu>

	* krb524d.c (kdc_get_server_key): If an enctype is given, then use
        iit even after falling back from trying a v4salt.  If we don't, we
        have a good chance fo getting the DES3 TGT service key, and that
        just doesn't do what we want.

Thu Jan 25 02:07:46 1996  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tertius.mit.edu>

	* cnv_tkt_skey.c (krb524_convert_tkt_skey): Take both a v5 and v4
 	service key.  Use the v5 service key to decrypt the v5 ticket, and
 	the v4 service key to encrypt the v4 ticket.

	* krb524d.c (do_connection): Use a separate v5 and v4 service key
 	so that if the KDC chooses to encrypt the v5 ticket in something
 	besides ENCTYPE_DES_CBC_CRC, we don't lose.  Also, make sure we
 	free keyblock contents and tickets on error.
	(lookup_service_key): Pass enctype to kdc_get_server_key

	(kdc_get_server_key):  Only try for v4 salt if the enctype is
	DES_CRC.  Take enctype as an argument.  This creates a problem
	if the server key has a normal and v4 salt of ENCTYPE_DES_CBC_CRC
	but I can't think of a good answer to this.


	* k524init.c (main):  Use crc32 not md5.

Wed Jan 24 20:05:47 1996  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tertius.mit.edu>

	* krb524d.c (kdc_get_server_key): Try to find a v4 salt type key,
 	else try any des_crc32 key, else fail.
	(do_connection): Lookup a crc32 key not an md5 key.
	(init_master): Handle reading kdc profile.

Sun Nov 12 04:29:08 1995  Mark W. Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* conv_creds.c (krb524_convert_creds_kdc): loop through all of the
	addresses returned by krb5_locate_kdc, don't just try the first one.
	* krb524d.c (do_connection): check for particular failures of
	decode_krb5_ticket, as well as for messages that are one int long
	(which will eliminate our own error replies.)

Mon Oct  9 11:34:24 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: s/test/krb524test/ to handle screw case where test
		is built and interferes with configure.

Mon Sep 25 00:15:47 1995  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* krb524d.c (do_connection): if recvfrom failed, just return,
	don't try to use the (likely invalid) sockaddr in a reply message.

Thu Sep 14 17:36:11 1995  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* krb524d.c (usage): needs to get context to pass to
	cleanup_and_exit so it does get freed, since it is allocated
	before parsing arguments.
	(main): change caller as well.

Wed Sep 06 14:20:57 1995   Chris Provenzano (proven@mit.edu)


        * cnv_tkt_skey.c, conv_creds.c, get_cred.c k524init.c krb524d.c,
	* test.c : s/keytype/enctype/g, s/KEYTYPE/ENCTYPE/g

Wed Sep  6 00:11:53 1995  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* krb524d.c (main): set timeout inside while loop to prevent spin.
	(cleanup_and_exit): free master_princ or close keytab, and free
	the global context, to eliminate spurious storage use in malloc
	debugging.
	(init_master): free realm.

Tue Sep 05 22:10:34 1995   Chris Provenzano (proven@mit.edu)

        * cnv_tkt_skey.c, getcred.c, k524init.c, krb524d.c, test.c : 
		Remove krb5_enctype references, and replace with
                krb5_keytype where appropriate.
