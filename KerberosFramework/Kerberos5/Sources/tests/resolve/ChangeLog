	LOCAL_INCLUDES such that one can override CFLAGS from the command
	line without losing CPP search patchs and defines. Some associated
	Makefile cleanup.

Sat Feb 22 20:28:32 1997  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* resolve.c (main): Make the test for a FQDN be a bit more

	* Makefile.in:
	* configure.in: Update to new program build procedure.

	* configure.in: Add KRB5_RUN_FLAGS

	* Makefile.in: Use runtime flags.

Wed Sep 13 13:57:40 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

Mon May  1 20:00:18 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* resolve.c (main): Add --quiet option which only prints the fully
		qualified domain name.  This will allow this routine to be
		used in the deja gnu tests to determine the FQDN of the
		local host.
