2004-12-20  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* pwhist.exp: New file.  Perform some sanity checking on password
	history mechanism, including erroneous loss of history when

	buffer overflows and memory leaks.

	causing any such info to be dumped into the debug log.
	* rsh.exp (stop_rsh_daemon): Likewise.

	* gssapi.exp (doit): Fix typo in log message.

2004-02-09  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

2002-03-07  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* standalone.exp: Move setting of KLIST and KDESTROY into
	default.exp.
	(doit): Call do_klist instead of implementing it here.  Add a new
	principal to the database, and test getting tickets using a
	keytab, with multiple kvnos starting at 253 and going up past
	256; if first supported enctype supports v4, convert the keytab to
	a srvtab and try getting tickets using it too.  Verify that

        * rsh.exp: Fix date-grabbing regexp to deal with older versions of
	expect/tcl that have limited regexp capabilities.

12001-11-02  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	places to drain pty buffers and avoid deadlock.

2001-11-02  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* v4gssftp.exp: Calling send_error from within a dejagnu test is
	wrong.  So is calling exit.  Fix to not do these things.  Expect
	eof rather than "\r" so as to drain pty buffers and avoid
	deadlock.

2001-11-02  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* gssftp.exp: Calling send_error from within a dejagnu test is
	wrong.  So is calling exit.  Fix to not do these things.  Expect
	eof rather than "\r" so as to drain pty buffers and avoid
	deadlock.

2001-10-26  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@mit.edu>

	* rcp.exp, rsh_exp (stop_rsh_daemon): Do not close a process and
	then look for eof. Some versions of expect go through a full

2001-10-25  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@mit.edu>

	* rsh.exp (rsh_test): Add stop_rsh_daemon before invoking
	start_rsh_daemon again to prevent running out of ptys.

2001-10-24  Mitchell Berger  <mitchb@mit.edu>

	* kadmin.exp: Corrected a couple of unimportant typos.  Added procedures
	kadmin_addpol, kadmin_delpol, kadmin_listpols, kadmin_modpol, and
	kadmin_showpol, which provide the tools with which to perform policy
	tests.  Added some basic policy operations to the tests of basic
	kadmin functions.  Added a test case to exercise the kadmind crash
	that used to occur when the history number of a policy was decreased.

2001-10-24  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* rcp.exp (stop_rsh_daemon): Call "expect eof" to drain pty buffer
	and avoid deadlock.

	* rsh.exp (stop_rsh_daemon, rsh_test): Call "expect eof" to drain
	pty buffer and avoid deadlock.

2001-07-04  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@mit.edu>

	* v4gssftp.exp, gssftp.exp: Test transfering a file > 1MB to
 	exercise PBSZ failure.

	* v4krb524d.exp: New tests for the krb524d and k524init programs. 

2001-06-08  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@mit.edu>

	* v4gssftp.exp: During test, set KRB5CCNAME to a non-existant
	cache. Restore at end to previous setting. This prevents failures
	caused when the krb5 cache contains valid information - as in the
	case of this test being run immediately after the gssftp.exp test.

2001-06-08  Mitchell Berger  <mitchb@mit.edu>

	* gssftp.exp: Invocation of ftpd changed to use -U /dev/null and
	-a so that the test may successfully be run by root without failing
	(i.e. root is granted ftp access) and without opening the running
	ftpd to a password attack (i.e. authorization is required).
	Check for successful login messages added.

	* v4gssftp.exp: Same changes.

2001-06-06  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@mit.edu>

	* v4gssftp.exp: Allow for "decrypt integrity check failed" error
	minor code from GSSAPI as well.

2000-07-04  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* rsh.exp: Drain buffers on klist test to avoid wedging rsh on
	exit under HP/UX.

	* gssapi.exp: Rework significantly to deal with HP/UX lossage that
	probably resulted from when either the client or the server wound
	up blocking on tty output.  Abstract things a little more.  Remove
	dead duplicate code that used to deal with "-v2".  Should figure
	out why the "-v2" stuff disappeared mysteriously.

2000-02-07  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* kadmin.exp: Use $KDESTROY -5 to deal with changed behavior.

2000-02-06  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* standalone.exp: Use $KLIST -5 and $KDESTROY -5 to deal with
	changed behavior in these programs.  Wait for eof in some cases to
	avoid hanging.

	* gssftp.exp: Check for "foo: No such file or directory" in
	addition to "foo not found".

		getting negative maxlife.

	* kadmin.exp: Added back in. Rewritten to use new admin system.

Tue Jul 23 23:40:05 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* kadmin.exp: removed, since it was for the old admin server.

Mon Jul 22 04:19:46 1996  Marc Horowitz  <marc@mit.edu>

	* gssftp.exp (ftp_test): check for the banner with -nocase, since
 	hostnames are case insensitive.

	* rcp.exp: Use a wrapper script to set up the remote rcp as
		started from kshd. 

	* rsh.exp: Setup a wrapper script in executing klist in the remote
		shell so that environment variables are properly set.

	* kadmin.exp: (kpasswd_cpw): After giving new password, wait for
		the newline or we hang waiting for the process to finish.

	Fri Mar 29 15:05:30 1996  Chris Provenzano  <proven@cygnus.com>

	* rsh.exp: Add tests for ticket forwarding.

	Thu Mar 28 19:30:53 1996  Marc Horowitz  <marc@mit.edu>

	* kadmin.exp and gssapi.exp: Fix syntax of expect_after blocks.
  	The -i $foo must be inside the {, and the { must be by itself at
 	the end of the line.
	* gssftp.exp (start_ftp_daemon): use krb5.conf, not krb.conf

	Thu Mar 28 17:32:47 1996  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@cygnus.com>

	* gssftp.exp (ftp_test): Explicitly select binary mode.

	Wed Mar 27 22:45:53 1996  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@cygnus.com>

	* kadmin.exp: Don't look at output from kadmind to drain it; that

	interface.
	(kadmin_add): match more of extended output (tentative change,
	should be expanded later to actually check the values.)

	* gssftp.exp: Fix the expect string so that it doesn't assume that
		the client is using its fully qualified domain name as its
		local hostname.  We now check to make sure that FTP banner
		contains $localhostname, plus optional characters (which
		can be the domainname depending on the system.)

Mon Apr  8 14:13:06 1996  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* rcp.exp: Invoke kshd with -L for every environment variable we

Sat Oct  7 08:02:08 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

		addv4 function test since it isn't supported in the same way.

	* kadmin.exp - Remove parameters from command lines of admin utilities
		because they're not needed anymore since we have the KDC

	* rcp.exp: (rcp_test()): Encrypted rcp are no longer expected to
		fail. 

Fri May 05 09:21:21 1995  Chris Provenzano (proven@mit.edu)
