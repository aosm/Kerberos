	eof to unsupported.

2003-06-04  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* default.exp (setup_root_shell): Don't try to use the procedure
	"-" when handling error messages from rlogin.

2003-06-03  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* default.exp (setup_root_shell): Handle error messages indicating
	"-x" isn't supported.
	(start_kerberos_daemons): "cannont" => "cannot".

2003-06-01  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* default.exp: Default RLOGIN_FLAGS to "-x".
	(start_kerberos_daemons): Watch for "Cannot bind server socket"
	and log it.  Watch for "no sockets set up" and report an error.
	(setup_root_shell): Watch for "Cannot assign requested address",
	log it and give up.

2003-05-21  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* default.exp: Be slightly more lenient about matching password
	prompts.

2003-05-16  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* default.exp (spawn_xterm): Add KPASSWD and REALMNAME to the list
	of exported variables.

2003-04-18  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* default.exp: Add passes for testing AES.
	(start_kerberos_daemons): Add a small delay between starting the
	"tail -f" processes and appending the markers to their files.
	(spawn_xterm): Add RLOGIN, RLOGIND, FTP, and FTPD to the list of
	variables to export to the environment.  Check that variables are
	defined before exporting them.

2003-03-28  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* default.exp (start_kerberos_daemons): If we get a timeout
	looking for the mark, log out the last 10 lines of the kdc
	logfile.

2003-03-26  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* default.exp (v4kinit): Expect failure when kiniting to a des3
	TGT, due to fix for MITKRB5-SA-2003-004.
	(setup_kadmind_srvtab): Remove.  It's not needed anymore.

2003-03-14  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* default.exp (setup_root_shell): If we get connection refused
	messages, followed by no unrecognized errors and then eof, report
	it as an unsupported test.

2003-03-14  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* default.exp (setup_root_shell): If we get connection refused
	messages, followed by no unrecognized errors and then eof, report
	it as an unsupported test.

2003-02-04  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* default.exp (start_kerberos_daemons): Use correct argument to
	"-4" flag.

2003-02-04  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@mit.edu>

	* default.exp (start_kerberos_daemons): Enable  krb4 

2003-01-23  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* default.exp (start_kerberos_daemons): Record more information
	when "tail -f" doesn't show the mark written to the log file.
	Look for and discard non-matching lines.
	(setup_root_shell): Ignore the message displayed by rlogin when
	a connection is refused to one address but other addresses are
	available.

2002-11-08  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* default.exp: Add (disabled) debugging code for catching leaking
	ptys.  expect eof from the correct spawn_ids when killing kdc and
	kadmind to avoid leaking ptys.
	(do_klist, v4klist, v4klist_none): Check for eof to avoid leaking
	ptys.

2002-10-07  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* default.exp (stop_kerberos_daemons): Kill, expect eof, wait, in
	that order.  Avoids delivery of multiple signals (HUP+TERM) to KDC
	daemons when shutting down.

2002-09-29  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* default.exp (start_kerberos_daemons): Fix to use "tail -f" to
	check for setup messages from daemons; this avoids a few race
	conditions.

2002-03-06  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* default.exp (modify_principal, kinit_kt, v4kinit_kt, do_klist,
	do_klist_kt, do_klist_err, do_kdestroy, xst, v4klist, v4kdestroy,
	v4klist_none): New procs.
	(add_random_key): No need to call expect_after in 'body' since
	both branches at invocation site will do it.
	(setup_root_shell, setup_root_shell_remote): Set correct value for
	KRB5_CONFIG.
	(passes): Add des-crc and des-md5 krb4 passes.
	(top level): Set KLIST and KDESTROY.
	(spawn_xterm): New proc useful for debugging only.
	(start_kerberos_daemons): Wait longer for "starting"
	line in log file.

2002-02-20  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@mit.edu>

	* default.exp (start_kerberos_daemons): In starting the kadmin
	daemon, the last line in the log file might read "Seeding random
	number" for a second. If that is the case, wait three seconds and
	refetch the last line of the log file to look for the "starting
	kadmind message"

2002-01-08  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* default.exp (start_kerberos_daemons): When standalone, delete
	KDC replay cache before starting it up.

2001-10-31  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* default.exp (check_k5login, check_klogin): Error out if there is
	a nonexistent .k5login or .klogin for root.
	(setup_{kadmind_,}srvtab, add_{random,kerberos}_key): Notice
	unmatched output to avoid timing out on certain errors.  Look for
	command echoes.  Clear the expect_after list in places to avoid
	problems with lingering expect_after clauses against invalid
	spawn_ids.  expect eof in places to avoid pty deadlock.

2001-10-27  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* default.exp: Mark as unused the test passes that won't
	accomplish anything due to disabling of SUPPORT_DESMD5 in the
	code.

2001-10-24  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* default.exp: Add support for setting SUPPORT_DESMD5 flag on the
	TGT principal.  Add test pass des.md5-tgt for exercising enctype
	similarity inconsistency.  Add test pass des.no-kdc-md5 for
	exercising failure to constrain session key issuance to
	permitted_enctypes.  Pepper the code with null calls to
	expect_after to prevent misfiring of expect_after clauses.
	(setup_srvtab): Look for some possible error cases to avoid timing
	out.
	(setup_root_shell): Restore timeout so we don't wait 5 minutes in
	other places.

2001-08-06    <epeisach@mit.edu>

	* default.exp (setup_root_shell): Also recognize "nection reset by
	peer" as a failure to get a root shell. This happens if
	tcp_wrappers are in use in inetd.conf, but rlogind is not prsent
	on the machine.

2001-06-22  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* default.exp: Use the interface variable $TMPDIR to allow the
	specification of an alternative temporary directory.  Wrap a loop
	around various testings and settings of interface variables that
	specify the locations of programs to be tested, e.g. $KADMIND.
	Add some support for having different sets of enctypes on client,
	server, and kdc.  The envstack changes and multiple config file
	support should get cleaned up somewhat later to possibly allow for
	programs to execute on different hosts.
	(check_k5login): Fix up to reflect actual (perhaps bogus) behavior
	of krb5_kuserok(), which doesn't do quite what we expect, so there
	really does need to be something like "luser@KRBTEST.COM" in the
	.k5login file.
	(check_klogin): New procedure; .klogin also needs to be checked
	for the v4gssftp test.
	(envstack_push, envstack_pop): New procedure; keep a stack of
	environment variable state, which is useful for running different
	programs with different config files.
	(setup_runtime_flags, setup_kerberos_env): Rewrite somewhat so
	they play nice with the envstack.
	(setup_krb5_conf): New procedure; write a config file with the
	contents parameterized based on the type of program that will use
	it.
	(setup_kerberos_files): Create different krb5.conf files for
	client, server, and kdc.
	(setup_kadmind_srvtab, setup_kerberos_db, start_kerberos_daemons):
	Rewrite to play nice with envstack.
	(setup_root_shell_noremote): New procedure from raeburn; handle
	the case where we're already running as root.
	(setup_root_shell): Call setup_root_shell_noremote as appropriate.
	
2001-06-17  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@mit.edu>

	* default.exp: Add an entry for krb524_server for the localhost
	with a non-standard port number.

2001-04-25  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@mit.edu>

	* default.exp: For Kerberos 4 tests, use a different ticket file
	name from the V5 tests.

2000-11-08  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* default.exp: Use $KRBIV rather than $KRB4 since dejagnu-1.3
	doesn't deal with digits in passed-in variables.

Thu Oct 12 12:06:03 2000  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@mit.edu>

	* default.exp: Add dict_file entry (and create one) for kdc.conf

Tue Aug 22 09:47:50 2000  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@mit.edu>

	* default.exp: Create a properly formatted krb.conf file.  Also
 	provide a krb4_srvtab stanza (even though we are falling back on
 	the keytab file) so the tests do not try to access an installed
 	systems /etc/srvtab file.

2000-08-09  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* default.exp: Add an eof clause to avoid breakage if rlogin exits
	too quickly.

2000-08-08  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@mit.edu>

	* default.exp: Create krb.conf and krb.realms files for v4
	compatibility. Set KRBTKFILE environment variable. Add
	v4_compatible_enctype() proc to test if krb4 tests are being run
	and if the current encryption type being tested is compatible with
	V4.  Added v4kinit() proc. Quoting of lists in mutipass variable
	assignments is unnecessary.

2000-08-07  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@mit.edu>

	* default.exp: Protect Quote quotation marks in multipass variable
	assignments. Dejagnu (June 1999 release) fails overwise. 

2000-07-22  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* default.exp: Add code to handle setting of PASS to constrain
	multipass testing to particular passes.  dejagnu-1.3 doesn't have
	support for PASS, so we kludge it here, though some later versions
	handle it by themselves.
	(krb_exit): Add new proc to clean up on exit.
	(kinit): Remove "expect \r" since "expect eof" will drain the pty
	buffer properly anyway.

2000-07-02  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* default.exp: Add rudimentary support for multiple passes.  For
	now, iterate over a few combinations of des_krbtgt and assorted
	enctype lists.  Will eventually allow for separate krb5.conf files
	for clients and servers.  Add varibles RLOGIN and RLOGIN_FLAGS to
	permit run-time configuration of rlogin program if necessary.  Set
	up an onexit handler that calls stop_kerberos_daemons.  Replace
	many uses of doubled-up send_log and verbose with single calls to
	verbose -log.  Replace instances of send_error with perror where
	appropriate, since this will cause successor test to fail, which
	is usually what we want.
	(setup_root_shell): Replace calls to untested with calls to
	unsupported; also use note for explanatory text previously printed
	using untested.  Add match string for "connection refused" and
	collapse common code into a single expect clause by using the -re
	flag.
	(start_kerberos_daemons): Conditionalize calls to fail based on
	$standalone; in the !$standalone case, call perror instead.  Calls
	to fail and pass for a given test should have consistent strings,
	and extraneous calls to fail should not be made in order to keep
	the total number of passed and failed tests constant regardless of
	success of setup steps.  Much remains to be done in this area
	though.

2000-05-31  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* default.exp (setup_kerberos_files): Include des3 in supported
	enctypes.

2000-02-07  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* default.exp: Remove default_tgs_enctypes for now as it was
	causing tests to fail when the tgt is DES3.  Need to investigate
	further.

2000-02-06  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* default.exp: Use $KINIT -5 to deal with modified kinit
	behavior.

1999-08-31  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* default.exp (setup_kerberos_files): Set kdc_supported_enctypes
	in kdc.conf, and include des3-cbc-sha1:normal.
	(setup_kerberos_db): If setting up krbtgt to use des3, now use
	only des3, not des3 and des-crc both.

1999-08-30  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@raeburn.org>

	* default.exp (des3_krbtgt): New variable.
	(setup_kerberos_files): Remove des3 from supported_enctypes in
	kdc.conf.
	(setup_kerberos_db): If des3_krbtgt is set, change krbtgt key, and
	get a des3 key in addition to des.

1999-08-27  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@raeburn.org>

	* default.exp: Set default principal expiration a bit further into
	the future.

1999-08-26  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* default.exp (setup_kerberos_files): Tweak enctypes entered into
	config files to exercise 3DES a little.

Fri Jan 30 23:48:57 1998  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* default.exp: Add kpasswd_server to krb5.conf.

Wed Jan 21 11:39:11 1998  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* default.exp: Added kpasswd_port variable to kdc.conf creation.
	(proven@cygnus.com)

Mon Nov 25 14:23:06 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* defualt.exp: Ezra's fix so that the dejagnu tests don't bomb out
 		if KRB5_KTNAME is set for some reason.

Tue Nov 19 15:13:30 1996  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* default.exp (check_k5login): Check for principal
 	$env(USER)@$REALMNAME rather than simply $env(USER), so that
 	kuser_ok dtrt, hopefully.

Mon Nov 11 20:52:27 1996  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* dejagnu: set env(TERM) dumb, find ktutil

	Tue Sep 17 20:58:43 1996  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@cygnus.com>

	* default.exp: Set terminal type to "dumb" to avoid interference
	from "resize".

	Tue Sep  3 02:27:40 1996  Mark W. Eichin  <eichin@kitten.gen.ma.us>

	* default.exp: find a path to ktutil, for the v4 tests.

	Wed Jun 12 12:56:10 1996  Mark W. Eichin  <eichin@kitten.gen.ma.us>

	* default.exp (setup_kerberos_files): set default_domain, so v4
	tests work.

Sun Nov 10 09:48:58 1996  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@mit.edu>

	* default.exp (setup_wrapper): Set KRB5_CONFIG in script.

Mon Aug 12 22:58:58 1996  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* default.exp: Rewrite to use kadmin.local instead of kdb5_edit.

Thu Aug  8 23:08:13 1996  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@mit.edu>

	* default.exp: In add_kerberos_key and add_random_key only execute
 	the final expect_after if the spawn ID is still open; also soak up
 	all the kadmin responses.

Thu Aug  8 22:13:27 1996  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tertius.mit.edu>

	* default.exp: Sleep for two seconds while waiting for KDC to
        start; sleep(1) doesn't always take up any time.

Mon Aug  5 21:16:48 1996  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* default.exp: Update to new kdb5_util convention.

Mon Jul 29 11:19:20 1996  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* default.exp: (kinit): Wait for eof from kinit before waiting for
		exit. 

Sat Jul 27 02:20:54 1996  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* default.exp: Rewrite to use kdb5_util instead of kdb5_create and
		kdb5_stash. No longer add the kadmin/admin and changepw
		keys to the database as this is handled automatically.

Fri Jul 19 19:50:23 1996  Marc Horowitz  <marc@mit.edu>

	* default.exp: changes to work with the new admin system.  This is
 	primarily creating the correct keytab for the new admin server,
 	and using the new admin client for principal creation.

Mon May  6 11:54:20 1996  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* default.exp: Add procedure setup_wrapper to first setup shared
		library environment variables and the exec program

Sat May  4 11:56:17 1996  Ezra Peisach  (epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu)

	* default.exp: For stty_init set to \^h as on some /bin/sh, ^ is
		treated as a pipe.

Fri May  3 20:48:16 1996  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@cygnus.com>

	Tue Apr  2 22:22:47 1996  Chris Provenzano  <proven@cygnus.com>

	* default.exp : Do an stty to set kill and erase correctly. 
		Things don't work if kill is set to '@'.

	Fri Mar 29 15:02:32 1996  Chris Provenzano  <proven@cygnus.com>

	* default.exp : Always use variable BINSH instead of sh.
		Use -f flag with kinit to get forwardable tickets.
		Setup kdc.conf to allow forwardable tickets.

	Thu Mar 28 17:30:55 1996  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@cygnus.com>

	* default.exp (touch, tail1): New proc.
	(start_kerberos_daemons, stop_root_shell): Use them, and sleep
	built-in command.

	Wed Mar 27 22:43:08 1996  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@cygnus.com>

	* default.exp (start_kerberos_daemons): Use ">>" to avoid updating
	mod time on kadmind log file.

	Wed Mar 27 21:35:57 1996  Marc Horowitz <marc@mit.edu>

	* default.exp: (start_kerberos_daemons): exec the kadmind
		inside an sh to redirect stderr (this is a pending
		bug), and keep the same pid, so that
		stop_kerberos_daemons doesn't leave a kadmind running.

	Wed Mar 27 21:24:35 1996  Marc Horowitz <marc@mit.edu>

	* default.exp: (start_kerberos_daemons): add a check for
		"cannot initialize network" as a failure message to
		the kadmind5 startup expect checks

	Wed Mar 27 21:10:47 1996  Marc Horowitz <marc@mit.edu>

	* default.exp (start_kerberos_daemons): use ezra's KDC tail
		changes for kadmind5, too.
	* rlogin.exp (start_rlogin_daemon): start klogind with sh -c
		so that setsid() won't fail due to the process already
		being the leader of a process group
	
Sun Apr  7 23:06:13 1996  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* default.exp: Major changes to use run time environment variables as
		passed in by configure. 

Tue Mar 26 00:38:14 1996  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* default.exp (start_kerberos_daemons): New methodology for
		starting KDC so that the KDC will not hang on a full
		output buffer which is being ignored.
		(setup_kerberos_files): Enable des3 encryption types.

Thu Mar 14 15:20:33 1996  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* default.exp (add_kerberos_key): clarify "lost KDC" text.

Mon Mar  4 20:45:30 1996  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* default.exp: Log krb5kdc to stderr so that test can detect
		properly when server has started. Change
		start_kerberos_daemons to take advantage of this.

Sat Oct  7 08:03:43 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* default.exp: Change kdc.conf ports definitions to current
		methodology. 

Thu Sep 28 18:54:43 1995  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* default.exp: set timeout to 100 since the default of 10 is
	ludicrous with NFS.

Wed Sep 13 14:02:03 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* default.exp: Save the key used to generate the database files.
		Also generate a set of environment setup scripts.

Sun Sep 10 10:09:41 1995  Ezra Peisach  (epeisach@dcl)

	* default.exp: Add des-cbc-crc to supported_enctypes as krb5_edit

		Remove parameters from command lines of admin utilities because
		they're not needed anymore since we have the KDC profile.  Also
		remove prompting for the master key since we have usage of the
		stash file.


Wed Jul 12 14:10:09 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* default.exp - Correctly set LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  Also set it before

	* default.exp: Use the principal "krbtest/admin@KRBTEST.COM" for
		kadmin 

Thu Jun 8 14:58:15 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)

Fri May 12 16:15:07 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* default.exp: Change to use new kadmin/kadmind.  Add entries for
		krbtest/kadmin5, changepw and extraction for changepw service
		entry.

Wed May 10 16:53:28 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* default.exp: Added domain_realm stanza to krb5.conf.
	               setup_srvtab: Takes optional service name to
		       		       extract.

	* default.exp: (get_hostname): The FQDN returned by resolve needs
		to be made lower case as the host name is entered directly
		into the database.

Mon May  1 21:32:57 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* default.exp: (get_hostname): Use tests/resolve/resolve to get
		the fully qualified domain name of the local host.
		Needed for systems where gethostname() doesn't return the
		FQDN. 

Thu Apr 27 00:22:30 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* default.exp: KRB5KDC: add -n to don't fork. Set up krb5.conf 
		and set KRB5_CONFIG to point to it.

Wed Apr 26 17:46:57 1995  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* default.exp (KADMIND, KADMIN): use kadmind.old, since these test
	the old server not the new (unfinished) one.
