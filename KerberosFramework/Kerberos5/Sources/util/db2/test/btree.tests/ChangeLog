	* main.c: Disable append(); we don't have R_APPEND in this release
	of DB for some reason.  Disable load() due to lack of fgetline().
	Conditionalize lots of things on -DSTATISTICS or -DDEBUG as
	appropriate.
	(rlist): New function; does recursive listing of principals.
	(main): Fix up naming of *_ENDIAN macros.  Default to read-only
	open, with new "-w" option for opening read/write.  Actually call
	db->sync with the correct number of arguments.
	(show): Update call to __bt_dpage().
	(usage): Update.

	* main.c (main): POSIX states that getopt returns -1
		when it is done parsing options, not EOF.
