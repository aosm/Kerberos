	* db-int.h: If stdint.h or inttypes.h are found, include them.

2002-08-23  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* db.h: Add rename and prototype for bt_rseq(); this is a kludge
	to avoid stuffing more things into the DB handle.

2001-10-24  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@mit.edu>

	* db-config.h.in: Remove unnecessary definitions for including
	db.h header file. These include WORDS_BIGENDIAN, ssize_t, u_short,
	int8_t, u_int8_t, int16_t, u_int16_t, int32_t.

2001-07-06  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@mit.edu>

	* db-dbm.h: New header file which lists the dbm interfaces.

	* db-ndbm.h: Change prototype from dirinfo to dirfno which matches
	code and ndbm API.

2000-07-01  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* db-config.h.in: New file; contains useful tidbits from
	config.h.in generated by autoheader.  It is needed because
	config.h.in has some thing we don't want to leak, like renaming of
	missing libc functions.

	* .cvsignore: Twiddle to reflect current reality.

	* db-int.h: #include config.h since db.h includes db-config.h
	which is not quite the same now.

2000-06-30  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* db-int.h: Remove renaming for memmove, strerror, mkstemp since
	this is now done by the build system.

Fri Feb 13 14:39:25 1998  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* db-int.h: Additional renaming.

	* db.h: Rename dbopen to avoid collision with NetBSD libc.

	* db-ndbm.h: Rename lots of functions to avoid collisions with
	native dbm implementations.

	* db-int.h: Rename __hash_open to avoid potential collision with
	NetBSD libc.

Thu Aug 15 15:41:12 1996  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* db-ndbm.h: Add prototypes for missing functions dbm_error() and
	 	dbm_clearerror().
