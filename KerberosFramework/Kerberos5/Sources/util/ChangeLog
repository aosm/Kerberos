	* def-check.pl: New file.  Not currently used by any automatic
	processes.  Checks krb5.hin against krb5_32.def for consistency;
	might work with other .h/.def files but hasn't been tested.

2001-10-10  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* depfix.sed: Change "foo.o" to "$(OUTPRE)foo.$(OBJEXT)" so that
