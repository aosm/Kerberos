    * ccdefault.c: Remove Mac header goober and include

	define.
	(ALLOC): New macro, with overflow checking.

	krb5_fcc_read_authdata): Use it, and fix other overflow checks.
	(my_fopen): Support non-Mac environments.
	(krb5_fcc_open_file) [USE_STDIO]: Always use my_fopen.
	(NO_FILE): New macro.  All functions changed to test or assign it
	rather than -1 or (FILE*)NULL.
	(krb5_fcc_read_keyblock, krb5_fcc_read_data): Rewrite bounds
	check.
	(BINARY_MODE): Always define.
	(setvbuf) [!HAVE_SETVBUF]: Define as macro using setbuf.
	(krb5_fcc_open_file): Change file descriptor variable to "f" and

	* ccdefops.c (krb5_cc_dfl_ops) [!USE_CCAPI]: Always use

	krb5_get_notification_message now static.  Minor other shuffling
	to become more similar to cc_stdio.c.
	(krb5_fcc_data): Rename "fd" to "file"; change all uses.
	* cc_stdio.c: All functions now static.  Rename all krb5_scc_
	functions, data types and macros to use krb5_fcc_ prefix instead.

	concatenation.  Choose lock flag value separately from call to

	(krb5_fcc_generate_new): Use BINARY_MODE.

2002-07-09  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* ccdefault.c: updated to new KLL function name

	k5-int.h to avoid problems with including CoreServices.h after
	profile.h and krb.h

	* ccdefault.c: Updated Mac OS X headers to new framework layout

	* ccdefops.c: created #define for USE_CCAPI now that both Mac OS 9
	and Mac OS 10 use ccapi.

	[pullups from 1-2-2-branch]

2002-04-10  Danilo Almeida  <dalmeida@mit.edu>

	* cc_file.c: Use _WIN32 instead of _WINSOCKAPI_ because
	_WINSOCKAPI_ depends on the Winsock header used (i.e., Winsock 2
	does not define this).  What we are really trying to check for is
	Win32.  Include port-sockets.h for Win32.  (NOTE: Why is
	NEED_SOCKETS being defined after the inclusion of k5-int.h?  That
	is pretty useless...  What we probably should do is more
	consitently used NEED_SOCKETS instead of manually putting in
	network code.  However, some people would probably have issues
	with the build being slower...)

2001-10-10  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@mit.edu>

	* cc_file.c (krb5_fcc_read): Remove const from fourth argument to
	function to match prototype earlier in file.

2001-10-09  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* cc_file.c, cc_memory.c, cc_stdio.c, ser_cc.c: Make prototypes
	unconditional.

	* cc_file.c, ccbase.c, cccopy.c, ccdefault.c, fcc.h, ser_cc.c:
	Don't use KRB5_DLLIMP.

2000-10-30  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* cc_stdio.c: Add a "mode" field to krb5_scc_data to keep track of
	what mode the file was opened in.
	(krb5_scc_close_file): Ignore EBADF from fflush() if the file was
	opened for readonly access.  For some reason NetBSD's fflush()
	exhibits this behavior.
	(krb5_scc_open_file): Save the mode with which the file was opened
	in data->mode.

2000-10-17  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@mit.edu>

	* cc_stdio.c, cc_file.c: Unsigned/signed int cleanup.

2000-10-03  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@mit.edu>

	* ser_cc.c (krb5_ccache_externalize): Use krb5_cc_get_name instead
	of krb5_rc_get_name on credential cache.

	* cc_file.c (krb5_fcc_get_name): 
	* cc_stdio.c (krb5_scc_get_name): 
	* cc_memory.c (krb5_mcc_get_name): 
	* ccfns.c (krb5_cc_get_name): Declare as returning const char *.

2000-09-25  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@mit.edu>

	signed/unsigned fixes.

Sat Sep 23 23:42:32 2000  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@mit.edu>

	* t_cc.c: Code cleanup. Test more failure modes of the cache library. 

	* cccopy.c (krb5_cc_copy_creds): Memory leak. Call krb5_cc_end_seq_get.

	* cc_file.c (krb5_fcc_generate_new): Set flags to
 	KRB5_TC_OPENCLOSE, otherwise parts of the library assumes that the
 	file is open, when it is not.

	* cc_stdio.c (krb5_scc_generate_new): Same as cc_file.c change.
	

2000-09-22  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Change ${CC} and ${OBJS} to $(CC) and $(OBJS) so
	nmake does not freak out.

	initialization.

2000-07-14  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* t_stdio.c, t_file.c, t_memory.c: Test cases copied from old
	subdirectories.  Currently unused.
	* Makefile.in (t_stdio): New target, basically same as 'test' in
	old stdio/Makefile.in.
	* file, memory, stdio: Subdirectories deleted.

	* cc_file.c, cc_stdio.c, cc_memory.c: New files, built from source
	files of appropriate subdirectories.
	* fcc.h, scc.h: New files, copied from subdirectories; temporary.
	* ccfns.c: New file, implementing what used to be krb5_cc_* macros

	Library routine.

2000-4-13	Alexandra Ellwood <lxs@mit.edu>

	* ccdefault.c: Added Kerberos Login library support (with ifdefs
	to control whether or not it is on.  Also added support to store a
	krb5_principal in the os_context along with the default ccache
	name (if known, this principal is the same as the last time we
	looked at the ccache.  * ccdefname.c: Added support to store a
	krb5_principal in the os_context along with the default ccache
	name (if known, this principal is the same as the last time we
	looked at the ccache.

1999-10-26  Wilfredo Sanchez  <tritan@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Clean up usage of CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS, DEFS, DEFINES,
	LOCAL_INCLUDES such that one can override CFLAGS from the command
	line without losing CPP search patchs and defines. Some associated
	Makefile cleanup.

	fcc_retrieve but takes an optional list of enctypes to look for in
	priority order.
	(krb5_cc_retrieve_cred_default): New function.  Same signature as

Tue May 18 19:52:56 1999  Danilo Almeida  <dalmeida@mit.edu>

1999-03-31  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* ccdefops.c: Change the default ccache type under windows to be
		original FILE ccache type; this will get set to ccapi if
		the krbcc32.dll can be found.

	* Makefile.in: Enable the ccapi directory for windows builds.

	* Makefile.in, ccdefops.c: Temporarily back out the ccapi ccache
		under Windows so we can make sure the rest of the krb5
		tree builds correctly under Windows.  (Note: I didn't
		revert lib/krb5/os/ccdefname.c, so setting KRB5_CC_NAME to
		FILE:C:\tmp\tkt is required to make things work.)

1998-08-24  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Add windows build instructions to build CCache API
		Cache implementation. 

Fri Aug 20 18:30:00 1998  Miro Jurisic  <meeroh@mit.edu>

Thu Jun  6 00:04:38 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

		Makefiles anyway.

Wed Feb  7 00:23:18 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* Makefile.in: Folded in danw's changes to allow

Fri Mar 17 19:19:07 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at toad.com)

	(CFLAGS):  Add -I options for file and stdio, to avoid paths in
	#include statements.
	(all-mac, clean-mac):  Add.
	* ccdefops.c:  Avoid includes with pathnames, since they don't work
	on the Mac.  Configure the default cache based on whether the
	system has <sys/types.h> (which defines types for low-level file
	operations, among other things).
	* configure.in (CONFIG_DIRS):  Build stdio before file, for Mac
