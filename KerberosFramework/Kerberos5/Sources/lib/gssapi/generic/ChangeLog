	* gssapi.h: Define gss_int32 -- needed for error code returns.

	* Makefile.in (EHDRDIR): Use $(S) instead of /, so that EHDRDIR is
		valid under windows.  Fix how the header file is copied in

	* gssapiP_generic.h: Include gssapi_generic.h instead of gssapi.h,
		so that we get the definitions of the nametype oids.

Wed Jul 24 18:48:43 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* oid_ops.c (generic_gss_release_oid): Re-enable function.

	* util_token.c (g_verify_token_header): Changed return code to be
		an int 32, since we return a com_err error code.

	* rel_buffer.c (generic_gss_release_buffer): 
	* rel_oid_set.c (generic_gss_release_oid_set): Remove INTERFACE
 		keyworded; not needed (and causes problems) since we're
 		not exporting this function to the DLL.

Tue Jul 23 16:44:50 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* util_validate.c: Only include <sys/file.h> if building with BSD_DB.

	* gssapiP_generic.h: Must include k5-int.h on Windows and
		Macintosh builds.

	* Makefile.in (SRCS): Renamed release_buffer.c to rel_buffer.c,
		and release_oid_set.c to rel_oid_set.c.  Marc broke the
		DOS 8.3 renaming which Gilmore had done to conform with
		DOS's filesystem constraints.

Fri Jun 21 18:02:51 1996  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* gssapi.h: Fix Win-16 build #defines for KRB5_CALLCONV and
	 	KRB5_DLLIMP.

Thu Jun 13 22:11:08 1996  Tom Yu  <tlyu@voltage-multiplier.mit.edu>

	* configure.in: remove ref to ET_RULES

Wed Jun 12 00:48:32 1996  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Update special rule for gssapi_err_generic.obj
		so that it uses the right Win-32 library command.

Wed Jun 12 00:46:41 1996  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* gssapi.h: Change INTERFACE to be KRB5_CALLCONV, which is where
		the calling convention is defined.  Add KRB5_DLLIMP
		which is where the DLL import/export should be put for
		Win32.  (Win16 is just different.)  The correct way to
		declare a function which will be used in a DLL is now:
		KRB5_DLLIMP func_return_t KRB5_CALLCONV func(long)

		Change function delcarations to use the new
		convention.  Actually, it doesn't hurt to use the old
		convention as long as func_return_t doesn't contain a
		'*'.  But in the long run we should be exterminating
		all uses of INTERFACE in favor of KRB5_CALLCONV and
		KRB5_DLLIMP.

Sun Apr 21 03:07:02 1996  Marc Horowitz  <marc@mit.edu>

	* gssapi_generic.c, release_buffer.c, release_oid_set.c: added
 	files which should have been added before, but either I or commit
 	was confused.

Wed Apr 17 20:59:23 1996  Marc Horowitz  <marc@mit.edu>

	* oid_ops.c: moved from mechglue
	
	* util_canonhost.c (g_canonicalize_host): cast the return value of
 	malloc()

	* gssapiP_generic.h: Added prototypes for oid_ops.c

	* gssapi.h: Make the types of OM_uint32 constants portable,
	fix some minor compile-time nits

	* Makefile.in: change the list of files which need to be built

Tue Apr  2 15:31:25 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* Makefile.in (SRCS): Inlined list of source files for SRCS and
		OBJS (for Macintosh build).

Thu Feb 29 19:39:23 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* util_token.c (der_length_size, der_write_size): Fix to work on
		16-bit platforms (we don't allow greater than 64k tokens
		on these platforms).

Tue Feb 27 17:49:54 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* gssapi.h (size_t): Make sure size_t and uid_t are defined under
	        MS-DOS.

Sat Feb 24 21:30:53 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* gssapi.h (GSS_S_DUPLICATE_ELEMENT): New error code function.
		XXX Need to square number assigment with official C-binds
		draft once it is issued.

Wed Jan 24 20:48:15 1996  Tom Yu  <tlyu@dragons-lair.MIT.EDU>

	* gssapi.h: Added definition of NPROTOTYPE to dtrt with Ultrix,
		etc.  Also added special case for Ultrix (limited
		prototype support).

Tue Jan 23 03:28:41 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* gssapiP_generic.h: Removed prototypes of functions that have
		been moved to the mechglue layer.

	* Makefile.in: Removed gssapi_generic.c, oid_ops.c, rel_buffer.c,
		and rel_oid_set.c --- these functions are now done in the
		mechglue layer.  

Wed Jan 10 21:31:42 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* Makefile.in (gssapi_err_generic.$(OBJEXT)): Added ##DOS
		statements after gssapi_err_generic.$(OBJECT) to get it
		added to library on Windows.  (Patch from Doug Engert).

	* gssapi.h: Remove #if statement that used sizeof(xxx), since that
		won't work for most C compilers/C preprocessors!

Thu Jan  4 21:33:38 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* gssapiP_generic.h (TWRITE_INT16, TREAD_INT16): Added new macros
		to read and write two byte integers from the wire.

	* gssapiP_generic.h: Don't include <sys/types.h> since it's
		already included by gssapi.h.

	* gssapi.h: Add a #ifndef _MACINTOSH around include of <sys/types.h>

	* Makefile.in, ChangeLog: Add support to compile shared libraries.

	* gssapi.h: Include sys/types.h, since that's where POSIX says
		size_t is defined.

Fri Oct  6 22:01:57 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* Makefile.in: Remove ##DOS!include of config/windows.in.
		config/windows.in is now included by wconfig.

Fri Sep 29 02:02:35 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* gssapi.h: For MS-DOS, use the brute force method of defining the
		size of variables; we should really get an autoconf file
		for MS-DOS.

Mon Sep 28 12:00:00 1995  John Rivlin <jrivlin@fusion.com>
	
	* gssapi_generic.h: Modified to use build in compiler symbols rather
		than relying on _MACINTOSH so the projects can include the file
		without using our headers.

	* Makefile.in: Removed "foo:: foo-$(WHAT)" lines from the
		Makefile. 

Mon Sep 25 16:53:00 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

		also we don't have limits.h


Thu Aug 31 11:43:59 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* gssapi.h - Update to V2 API.  Also use autoconf.h if USE_AUTOCONF_H
		is defined, otherwise resort to brute force.  Remove const_
		gss_OID, as it's not defined in the API.
	* gssapiP_generic.h - Add new V2 dispatch prototypes.  Update
		arguments to be compatible with V2 API.
	* disp_major_status.c - Describe new failure codes.  Update argument.

		conditionally k5-sockets.h.


Fri Jul 7 16:22:49 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* Makefile.in - Remove LDFLAGS, it's set by configure.

Fri Jun  9 19:25:47 1995    <tytso@rsx-11.mit.edu>

	* configure.in: Remove standardized set of autoconf macros, which
		are now handled by CONFIG_RULES.

Wed May 24 06:52:41 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* gssapiP_generic.h: Include k5-sockets.h now that k5-config.h
		does not include netdb.h.

Mon May 22 10:08:13 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* Makefile.in	- Install EXPORTED_HEADERS in gssapi subdirectory of
			  KRB5_INCDIR.
	* configure.in	- Find KRB5ROOT and install program.

Thu Apr 20 11:41:04 1995    <tytso@rsx-11.mit.edu>

	* configure.in: Add checking for SIZEOF_SHORT, SIZEOF_INT, and
		SIZEOF_LONG, so we don't need to depend on getting this
		information from include/krb5/autoconf.h

	* gssapi.h: Removed dependence on krb5 include files.

	* gssapiP_generic.h: We need to include k5-config in order to get
		Windows specific hackery.  Somewhat of a wart, but this is
		a gssapi internal header file, so the rest of the world
		doesn't have to see this.

	* util_token.c: Define VALID_INT, instead of relying on this being
		defined by krb5.h.

Thu Apr 13 16:27:56 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* gssapi_e.c: __STDC__ conditional also checks the _WINDOWS define.
	* *.[ch]: removed unneeded INTERFACE from non-api functions.
        * *.h added FAR to pointers visible at to the world.

Tue Mar 28 18:28:03 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at toad.com)

        * util_tok.c: had to coerce long to int on TWRITE_STR.
        * gssapi.h: made typedef for OM_uint32 machine independent and
          added INTERFACE to prototypes.

Mon Feb 20 12:00:00 1994  Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	More DOS 8.3 renames--for files created by make
	* gssapi_generic_err.et   => gssapi_err_generic.et
				  => gssapi_err_generic.h
				  => gssapi_err_generic.c
	* gssapiP_generic.h was changed to match
