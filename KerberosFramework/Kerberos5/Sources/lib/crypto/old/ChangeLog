2004-02-18  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* des_stringtokey.c: Use ANSI C style function definitions.

2003-07-22  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* old_decrypt.c (krb5_old_decrypt): Use block_size and hashsize
	fields instead of calling functions.
	* old_encrypt.c (krb5_old_encrypt_length, krb5_old_encrypt):
	Likewise.

2003-07-17  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (LIBNAME) [##WIN16##]: Don't define.

2003-05-23  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@mit.edu>

	* des_stringtokey.c (krb5int_des_string_to_key): If param has  one
	byte, treat it as a type.   Type 0 is normal, type 1 is AFS
	string2key. 

2003-03-04  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* des_stringtokey.c (krb5int_des_string_to_key): Renamed from
	krb5_... and added s2k-params argument which must be null.
	* old.h: Updated.

2003-01-10  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Add AC_SUBST_FILE marker for libobj_frag.

2002-08-29  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Revert $(S)=>/ change, for Windows support.

2002-08-23  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Change $(S)=>/ and $(U)=>.. globally.

2001-10-09  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* des_stringtokey.c, old.h: Make prototypes unconditional.

2001-10-03  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* des_stringtokey.c: Don't explicitly declare pointers FAR any
	more.

2001-04-10  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* old_decrypt.c (krb5_old_decrypt): Fix casts.
	* old_encrypt.c (krb5_old_encrypt): Likewise.

2001-03-13  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (STLIBOBJS): Undo last change.

2001-03-09  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* old_decrypt.c (memmove): Delete macro definition.
	(krb5_old_decrypt): Define with prototype form.
	* old_encrypt.c (krb5_old_encrypt_length, krb5_old_encrypt):
	Define with prototype form.

	* Makefile.in (STLIBOBJS): Nothing uses des_stringtokey.o, drop
	it.

2001-03-05  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* des_stringtokey.c, old.h, old_decrypt.c, old_encrypt.c: Use
	const instead of krb5_const.

2000-06-03  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* old_encrypt.c (krb5_old_encrypt): Chain ivecs.

	* old_decrypt.c (krb5_old_decrypt): Chain ivecs.

2000-01-21  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* des_stringtokey.c (mit_des_string_to_key_int): Declare.
	* old_decrypt.c (krb5_old_decrypt): Delete unused variable.
	Change if(a=b) constructs to silence gcc warning.
	* old_encrypt.c (krb5_old_encrypt): Change if(a=b) constructs to
	silence gcc warning.

1999-10-26  Wilfredo Sanchez  <tritan@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Clean up usage of CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS, DEFS, DEFINES,
	LOCAL_INCLUDES such that one can override CFLAGS from the command
	line without losing CPP search patchs and defines. Some associated
	Makefile cleanup.

1999-08-25  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* old_decrypt.c (memmove) [HAVE_BCOPY && !HAVE_MEMMOVE]: Define to
	use bcopy.  Should work unless any system has no memmove *and*
	bcopy isn't safe with overlaps.

Mon May 10 15:20:32 1999  Danilo Almeida  <dalmeida@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Do win32 build in subdir.

Wed Dec 16 16:14:02 1998  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* old_decrypt.c (krb5_old_decrypt): Initialize the ivec to the key
 	if we're using DES_CBC_CRC, for backwards compatibility.  We
 	weren't noticing this before because it only trashes the first
 	block, which is the confounder, which we weren't actually
 	verifying because checksum was unconditionally succeeding prior to
 	the other patch.

Thu Dec 10 22:16:14 1998  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* old_decrypt.c (krb5_old_decrypt): Actually compare the
	calculated checksum against the provided checksum.

1998-11-13  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Set the myfulldir and mydir variables (which are
		relative to buildtop and thisconfigdir, respectively.)
