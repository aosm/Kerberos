Tue May 21 22:33:12 1996  Richard Basch  <basch@lehman.com>

	* md4crypto.c: Incorrrect size arguments were being passed causing
	decrypt integrity failures with the "fixed" md4 algorithm.  The old
	path was also fixed to better reflect the appropriate size variables
	even though the two in use were identical (if someone copied the
	code to make a new crypto system, they may spend a long time
	debugging because of the misuse of variables).
	[Tracked down by epeisach; audited by basch.]

	* md4crypto.c: Define MD4_K5BETA_COMPAT and MD4_K5BETA_COMP_DEF so
 		that we continue doing things the wrong (broken) way.  All
 		hail backwards compatibility....  The code now generates
 		the old checksum, but it will verify both the old and the
 		correct checksum formats.

		Also fixed two bugs in the "correct" MD4_CRYPTO
		implementation; use a zero initialization vector, and
		calculate the confounder at the beginning of the message,
		not at the end.

		Run t_mddriver on a "make check", to make sure we have a
		valid MD4 implementation.

		constants are compiled.  If we have an ANSI C environment,
