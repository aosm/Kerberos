2001-10-09  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

2001-04-26  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

Wed Oct  21 17:40:00 1998  Miro Jurisic <meeroh@mit.edu>

	* Metrowerks: Added CodeWarrior Pro4 projects and docs
	* CodeWarrior Dependencies: Added CodeWarrior Pro4 deps

Wed Jul  1 19:13:25 1998  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* KerberosHeaders.h: Removed #endif with no matching initial #if
		statement.  (How did this compile before?)

Tue Sep 30 19:04:20 1997  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* autoconf.h: Replace HAS_STDLIB_H with something more sane.  Punt
	POSIX_TYPES.

Thu Sep 25 21:05:23 1997  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* autoconf.h: Change HAS_SETVBUF, KRB5_USE_INET to something more
 	sane.

Thu Sep 18 17:59:05 1997  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* autoconf.h: Replace USE_STRING_H with something more sane.

Tue Jul 15 12:36:05 1997  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* KerberosHeaders.h: Remove (probably unneeded) size_t definition.

Sat Nov 23 00:18:20 1996  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* KerberosHeaders.h: Remove DES3 and SHA support for 1.0, since
	 	what's there isn't the correct final algorithm.  (They
	 	will be re-added later.)  [PR #231]
	
Tue Apr 30 14:53:54 1996    <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* KerberosHeaders.h: Removed PROVIDE_SNEFRU (shouldn't be there)
		and added PROVIDE_CRC32 (was originally in k5-int.h).

Wed Apr 10 10:14:22 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* KerberosHeaders.h (PROVIDE_DES_CBC_RAW): Fix #define of
		PROVIDE_DES_CBC_RAW so that the mac implementation
		actually exported the raw DES encryption system (needed
		for GSSAPI).  Also added defines for the triple-DES
		encryption systems.

Wed Mar 27 00:07:46 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* KerberosHeaders.h: Add #define of HAVE_STDLIB_H, since
		Macintoshes have it!

Wed Wed 27 18:00:00 1995  John Rivlin <jrivlin@fusion.com>

	* KerberosHeaders.h: Created the file with the contents of 
		KerberosHeaders.pch so that KerberosHeadersCFM.pch can 
		also use it.
	
	* KerberosHeadersCFM.pch: Added file so that CFM compiler
		can	use a private binary header file.

Wed Wed 27 12:00:00 1995  James Mattly <mattly@fusion.com>

	* autoconf.h: File is now moved to include directory as 
		Makefile.in is run to create kerbsrc.tar.  Also 
		the file has been cleaned up as it is not
		automatically generated.

	* libraries.sit.hqx: Mac project files have been reworked.
		The CFM projects are now called "Kerberos 5 Library"
		and "GSS Library".  The GSS library project includes 
		the Kerberos 5 Library so you must install both
		libraries in the system folder to use the GSS API
		interface.

Wed Sep 20 12:00:00 1995  James Mattly <mattly@fusion.com>

	* libraries.sit.hqx: Updated project files to exclude verification 
		files so users can link without the benefits of a 
		preimplemented main.

	* KerberosHeaders.pch:  Updated to handle change password.

Sun Sep 10 12:00:00 1995  James Mattly <mattly@fusion.com>

	* ChangeLog created

	* libraries.sit.hqx: Project files changed to include new files 
		and renamed files.
