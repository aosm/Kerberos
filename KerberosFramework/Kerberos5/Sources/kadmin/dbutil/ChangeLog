	comment

2002-07-31  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

2000-07-05  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* dump.c: Various message char arrays turned into macros, to
	permit gcc to verify format strings and arguments match.  
	(k5beta6_dump_header, k5beta7_dump_header): Deleted.
	(dump_ov_princ): Use %lx for aux_attributes.

2000-06-30  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* dump.c: Add a new dump version, r1_3_version, and make it the
	default; it will be used in krb5-1.3 and will permit a principal's
	kadm5 data to be dumped.  This is an interim measure until we
	redesign the dump format somewhat.

2000-05-31  Wilfredo Sanchez  <tritan@mit.edu>

	* ovload.c: Check for existance of <memory.h>.
	[from Nathan Neulinger <nneul@umr.edu>]

1999-10-26  Wilfredo Sanchez  <tritan@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Clean up usage of CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS, DEFS, DEFINES,

	line without losing CPP search patchs and defines. Some associated
	Makefile cleanup.

1999-07-06  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* kdb5_util.c (main): Do try using com_err in the case that
	krb5_init_context fails, instead of fprintf of the error number.

1998-11-13  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Set the myfulldir and mydir variables (which are

	flag.

Wed Aug 19 14:52:40 1998  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* kdb5_util.c (add_random_key): New function to create a new
 	random key for a principal while retaining the previous kvno's
 	keys.  This is only temporary until a reasonable kadm5 interface
	is made.

1998-05-06  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* kdb5_stash.c (argv): 
	* kdb5_destroy.c (kdb5_destroy): 
	* kdb5_create.c (kdb5_create): POSIX states that getopt returns -1
		when it is done parsing options, not EOF.

Fri Feb 27 23:32:38 1998  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Changed thisconfigdir to point at the kadmin
 		directory, since we've moved all of the configure.in
		tests to the toplevel kadmin configure.in

Wed Feb 18 15:55:06 1998  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Remove trailing slash from thisconfigdir.  Fix up

	lock/unlock code) to avoid reopening on every record.

Mon Nov 11 16:50:25 1996  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* kadmin/dbutil dumpv4 expiration ("never") fixes
	* kadmin/dbutil loadv4 stashfile, default fixes

	Fri Sep 27 18:45:43 1996  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* dump.c (read_string): fgetc doesn't return char.
	
	Wed Sep 11 23:45:11 1996  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* loadv4.c (enter_in_v5_db): set last_pwd_change from the
	mod_time, not only the mod_princ_data.
	
	Wed Sep 11 00:02:33 1996  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* dumpv4.c (dump_v4_iterator): detect expiration time of "never"
	and fill in a reasonable default (namely, the Cygnus 96q1 default
	of 12/31/2009.)

	* loadv4.c (v4_dump_find_default): New function. Scans a dumpfile
 	for a "default" entry, which was probably created at kdb_init time
 	and probably hasn't changed from either the MIT default of
 	12/31/1999 or the Cygnus 96q1 default of 12/31/2009.  Check for
 	either value, and replace it with 0, which is understood as
 	"never" in V5.  If verbose is set (-v flag), log either the match
	or the non-matching value.
	(process_v4_dump): new argument default_exp_time, the value found
 	by v4_dump_find_default, actually performs the replacement of
	matching entries.
	(load_v4db): call v4_dump_find_default to get the default
	expiration time.
	* kdb5_util.M: document the above changes.

	Sun Sep  8 01:02:47 1996  Mark W. Eichin  <eichin@kitten.gen.ma.us>

	* kdb5_util.c (usage): document load_v4 -s stashfile.
	(main): fix typo in usage message.

Thu Nov  7 20:53:17 1996  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* configure.in: Remove spurious WITH_KRB4.

Tue Nov  5 16:16:53 1996  Barry Jaspan  <bjaspan@mit.edu>

	* dump.c (load_db): minor fix to code that verifies the specified
 	load version matches the file (autodetect worked anyway)

Fri Oct 18 14:23:41 1996  Barry Jaspan  <bjaspan@mit.edu>

	* dump.c (load_db): osa_adb_rename_policy_db will create the db,
 	so this function doesn't have to [krb5-admin/58]

	* dump.c (dump_k5beta6_iterator): don't dump tl types that are
 	special to us and the previous version did not understand
 	[krb5-admin/89]

Tue Oct  8 13:35:56 1996  Barry Jaspan  <bjaspan@mit.edu>

	* dump.c (load_db): rework the way policy database naming and
 	renaming is handled; the code no longer depends on being able to
 	specify admin_dbname specifically (which is no longer supported by
 	the libraries), uses osa_adb_rename_policy instead of doing it
 	directly, and will create a policy db if one does not already
 	exist.  Automated testing is needed. [krb5-admin/62]

	* dump.c (load_db): rename osa_adb_rename_policy to *_db

Thu Oct  3 18:17:36 1996  Barry Jaspan  <bjaspan@mit.edu>

	* kdb5_util.c (ARG_VAL): case second half of ?: operator to char *
 	to fix problem on AIX; this should have worked anyway because of
 	the , operator but it is easy enough to force the solution, too.
	[krb5-admin/41]

Tue Sep 10 14:16:40 1996  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* kdb5_edit.M: remove extra args from .TH

	* kdb5_util.M: remove ".so man1/header.doc"

Mon Sep  9 11:06:29 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* loadv4.c: Don't call get_config_params again, since it's not
 		necessary, and breaks the policy database name if it is
 		manually set.

Wed Sep  4 17:34:58 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* loadv4.c (load_v4db): Fix argument parsing so that it actually works!
		Eliminated the -f option, as it is superfluous.  Don't
		create the policy database if using the -t option, since
		it'll already exist.

	* kdb5_util.c (usage): Fix usage message so that it's correct for
	 	load_v4.

Tue Sep  3 22:12:54 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

		for shared libraries.

Mon Aug 12 11:41:57 1996  Barry Jaspan  <bjaspan@mit.edu>

	* kdb5_util.c: make mkey_password non-static

Mon Aug  5 21:24:47 1996  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* kdb5_stash.c (kdb5_stash): Ignore (expected) failure in stashing
		key when key not already present in returning exit status.

Mon Aug  5 14:36:47 1996  Barry Jaspan  <bjaspan@DUN-DUN-NOODLES>

	* all files: reworked for non-ss usage; kdb5_util_ct.ct and
        ss_wrapper.c are now obsolete

Thu Aug  1 14:34:51 1996  Barry Jaspan  <bjaspan@DUN-DUN-NOODLES>

	* dump.c, kadm5_create.c, kdb5_create.c: create policy database
        and kadm5 principals when loading a databas

	* loadv4.c: create empty policy database after loading V4 dump file

Sat Jul 27 02:16:01 1996  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>
	* kdb5_create.c (kdb5_create): Ignore (expected) failure in
		open_db_and_mkey when creating database in returning exit
		status.

Wed Jul 24 02:57:16 1996  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tertius.mit.edu>

	* loadv4.cdumpv4.c : Fixes for Athena Kerberos

Wed Jul 24 02:47:07 1996  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@mit.edu>

	* configure.in: Check for kdc.h and krb_db.h for Athena Kerberos.

Tue Jul 23 17:03:42 1996  Tom Yu  <tlyu@voltage-multiplier.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: add dependency for kdb5_util_ct.o

	* configure.in: removed SS_RULES

Wed Jul 10 19:43:22 1996  Marc Horowitz  <marc@mit.edu>

	* dumpv4.c (configure.in, Makefile.in): make autoconf work after
 	barry's carnage

Sun May 12 00:27:44 1996  Marc Horowitz  <marc@mit.edu>

	* loadv4.c (enter_in_v5_db, add_principal), kdb5_edit.c
 	(create_db_entry, modent), dumpv4.c (dump_v4_iterator), dump.c
 	(dump_k5beta_iterator, process_k5beta_record): convert to use new
 	krb5_dbe_* tl_data functions.

	* cpw.c (enter_pwd_key): krb5_dbe_cpw() takes a kvno now.

Tue May  7 23:16:57 1996  Marc Horowitz  <marc@mit.edu>

	* configure.in: USE_KADM_LIBRARY replaced by USE_KADMSRV_LIBRARY

Thu Apr 11 19:32:36 1996  Richard Basch  <basch@lehman.com>

	* kdb5_edit.c (extract_v4_srvtab): Use the matching key_data's kvno;
	don't assume that key_data[0]'s kvno is necessarily the matching
	key_data's kvno.

Wed Apr 10 19:17:58 1996  Richard Basch  <basch@lehman.com>

	* kdb5_edit.c (extract_v4_srvtab): Translate the principal name to
	the common V4 name.

Tue Mar 19 18:00:58 1996  Richard Basch  <basch@lehman.com>

	* kdb5_edit.c (extract_v4_srvtab): do not test to make sure we
	fetched a key of enctype 1 (des-cbc-crc), since we may have gotten
	another des key from the database, which is just as useful in a
	v4 srvtab

	* dumpv4.c (dump_v4_iterator): use krb5_524_conv_principal to do the
	v5 to v4 principal translation, instead of having yet another
	hard-coded table.

Wed Mar  6 16:17:20 1996  Richard Basch  <basch@lehman.com>

	* dumpv4.c: The V4 master key & schedule was never initialized,
	so the dump created by dump_v4db was garbage.	Read the V4
	master key from /.k or prompt for the V4 master key password.
	  If there is no V4-salt key in the database, but there is a DES
	key, include it in the V4 dump, in case it is merely a random 
	service key for which there is no associated password.
	  Skip over K/M in the V5 database (use the entered V4 master key).
	  Both krbtgt and afs keys often have domain-qualifed instances.

Tue Mar  5 12:18:22 1996  Richard Basch  <basch@lehman.com>

	* dump.c: POSIX locking requires that the file be opened read-write.

		(with -r), use krb5_set_default_realm so that created keys
		will have the correct realm.

		others.... 

Wed Nov 16 01:03:42 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin@cygnus.com)

	* dumpv4.c: new file. New command dump_v4db which creates a v4
	slave dump out of a v5 database, leaving out any keys which aren't
	using v4 salt, and any keys that aren't for the current
	realm. Reencrypts using v4 master key, synthesizes arbitrary
	master key version number.
	* configure.in: use WITH_KRB4 for dump support.
	* kdb5_ed_ct.ct: add new dump_v4 command.

		master key password can be entered on the command line ---
		for testing only; not documented!!
