2004-12-17  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* shlib.conf (*-*-netbsd*): Use -fPIC instead of -fpic, which
	won't work on sparc64 at least.

2004-12-15  Jeffrey Altman <jaltman@mit.edu>

        * win-pre.in; optionally build debug symbols for release builds
                      and rename krb5support_32.dll to k5sprt32.dll

	if using native linker, with check for native linker if gcc is
	being used.

2004-09-21  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* shlib.conf (*-*-linux*, *-*-gnu*, *-*-k*bsd*-gnu): Don't use the
	linker option --retain-symbols-file, it doesn't work for shared
	libraries.

2004-09-17  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* pre.in (INSTALL_SCRIPT): New variable; use to install scripts,
	as we don't want to strip scripts.

	LDFLAGS.  Force static libraries only always, instead of just as
	the default.
	(*-*-aix*): The initfini argument should be "-binitfini".  Use
	-bernotok, not -berok.  Do use the INIT_FINI_PREP command in
	constructing MAKE_SHLIB_COMMAND.

	* pre.in (PTHREAD_CFLAGS): New variable.
	(ALL_CFLAGS): Include it.

	* win-pre.in (SLIB): New variable.

2004-06-16  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* mac-config.README, mac-config.cache, mac-mf.sed, mac-post.in,
	mac-pre.in: Files deleted.

2004-06-08  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	finalization.

2004-05-27  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* win-pre.in (CP): Copy nul: plus the file, to avoid carrying over
	the original modification time, since some of our makefiles depend
	on $(CP) updating the timestamp.  Use binary mode for the copy,
	because default/ASCII seems to cause a ^Z to be added to the
	file.

2004-05-12  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* shlib.conf (*-*-linux*): Use GNU linker's --retain-symbols-file

	* pre.in (EXTRA_FILES): New variable.
	* post.in (clean-unix): Delete extra files.

	* shlib.conf: Initialize use_linker_init_option and
	use_linker_fini_option to no.
	(mips-sgi-irix*): Add link-time support for library
	initialization and finalization.
	(*-*-solaris*): Likewise, for native compiler.  Change "pic" mode
	to "PIC", libkrb5 seems to need it now.

2004-04-28  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* libobj.in (.c.so): Add -DSHARED to compile options.

2004-04-26  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	(lib$(LIB)$(PFLIBEXT)): Use it.

	* shlib.conf (INIT_FINI_PREP): New variable.  Default to a no-op,

	MAKE_SHLIB_COMMAND value.
	(case mips-sgi-irix*): Define LDCOMBINE_TAIL to use the library's
	export list.

	LDCOMBINE_TAIL): Delete unused variables.
	(SHLIB_EXPORT_FILE, SHLIB_EXPORT_FILE_DEP, MAKE_SHLIB_COMMAND):
	New variables.
	* lib.in (lib$(LIB)$(SHLIBVEXT)): Depend on
	SHLIB_EXPORT_FILE_DEP.  Set objlist to the list of object files
	before invoking MAKE_SHLIB_COMMAND, instead of wrapping the list
	with LDCOMBINE and LDCOMBINE_TAIL.
	* shlib.conf: Set MAKE_SHLIB_COMMAND, using LDCOMBINE and
	LDCOMBINE_TAIL in the common case.
	(case *-*-aix*): Specify new commands, taken from makeshlib.sh,
	but assume the export list is provided externally.

	pointing to a fake destdir, as well as to the real root directory.
	Previously, pointing _RLD_ROOT at a non-existent directory and
	putting everything in LD_LIBRARY_PATH caused other installed
	utilities with RPATHs which were run by the test suite to fail to
	run.

2004-02-09  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* shlib.conf: Add Solaris support for LD_PRELOAD.

2003-09-26  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* post.in (configure): Make configure depend on configure.in and
	aclocal.m4 only if maintainer mode is enabled.

2003-09-13  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* shlib.conf (*-*-linux*): Use $(CC) for linking shared libraries,
	and -Wl to pass linker flags in, so it can supply the necessary
	support libraries.

	* libobj.in: Change .c.so and .c.po rules to use ALL_CFLAGS.

	* pre.in (ALL_CFLAGS): Add KRB_INCLUDES.
	(KRB_INCLUDES): Move from aclocal.m4, where it had been added to
	CPPFLAGS.  This move allows CPPFLAGS to be used by the builder.

	* shlib.conf: Add CFLAGS to many places where only LDFLAGS had
	been previously.

2003-02-12  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* post.in (.dtmp): Use -DDEPEND to allow source files to exclude
	inclusions from dependencies.

2003-01-10  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* lib.in (LN_S, AR, LIBLIST, LIBLINKS, LIBINSTLIST, STLIBEXT,
	SHLIBVEXT, SHLIBSEXT, SHLIBEXT, PFLIBEXT, LDCOMBINE,

	variables...
	* libobj.in (OBJLISTS, SHLIBOBJS, PFLIBOBJS, LDCOMBINE, SONAME,
	PICFLAGS, PROFFLAGS): ...and these...
	* pre.in: ...to here.

2002-12-23  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* pre.in: Add variables for krb524 and krb4 generated headers for
	dependencies.

2002-12-12  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* post.in: Fix depend rules to keep state about whether
	verification of various things succeeded.  Change some double
	colons to single colons.  Add a new depend-dependencies target to
	allow Makefile.in to specify things that must be built for depend
	to work.

	* pre.in: Fix recursion rules to use fewer double colons.

2002-12-09  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* post.in: depfix2.sed -> .depfix2.sed to avoid a little clutter.

2002-11-27  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* post.in (clean-unix): Clean depfix2.sed as well.

2002-11-13  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@bu.edu>

	* pre.in (AUTOCONFINCFLAGS): Define by configure.

	"-blibpath:" by adding a variable RPATH_TAIL.  Fix typo in non-gcc
	case.

2002-11-08  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	building static and are capable of shared libs, in case there's a
	shared tcl lib).

	* shlib.conf: New variable RPATH_FLAG. 

2002-10-07  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@mit.edu>

	* pre.in post.in (RECURSE_TARGETS): Add install-headers-recurse

2002-09-24  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@bu.edu>

	* post.in (Makefile): Run config.status to generate only the
	specific makefile that changed.

2002-09-24  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* pre.in (.et.c, .et.h): Change rules to only update the desired
	target file, by using temporary files; this makes them safe for
	use in parallel builds.

2002-09-19  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@bu.edu>

	* post.in (Makefile): Revert change until aclocal.m4 fixed.

2002-09-19  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@bu.edu>

	* post.in (Makefile): Run config.status to generate only the

	inputs to depgen.sed.  Don't emit any other text.

2002-09-03  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* libobj.in (.c.so, .c.po): Put LOCALINCLUDES before CPPFLAGS.

	* pre.in (ALL_CFLAGS): Put LOCALINCLUDES before CPPFLAGS.
	(SS_LIB-sys): Use @SS_LIB@ substitution.

2002-08-29  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* pre.in (COM_ERR_DEPLIB-sys, COM_ERR_DEPLIB-k5, SS_DEPLIB-k5,

2002-08-26  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@bu.edu>

	* pre.in: Set host to @krb5_cv_host@ instead of @host@. The way
	aclocal.m4 is setup, AC_CANONICAL_HOST may only be evaluated as a
	cached variable and autoconf 2.52 will only allow one inclusion of
	the code.

2002-08-23  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* pre.in (S, U): Variables deleted.

2002-08-14  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	$(OBJS) in one command, to avoid needing to test whether the
	latter is empty.

2002-04-10  Danilo Almeida  <dalmeida@mit.edu>

	* win-pre.in: Define KRB5_PRIVATE=1 so that private definitions
	are used.  Define WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN so there are no Winsock
	vs. Winsock 2 header file issues.  (Winsock 2 is needed for IPv6
	support.)

2002-04-02  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* pre.in: Add support for doing optional stripping of programs.

2002-03-26  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	command.

	* libobj.in (config.status): Depend on shlib.conf.

2001-12-18  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* shlib.conf: Fix hpux to deal with building shared libs with gcc.
	Patch from Doug Engert; fixes krb5-build/1021.

2001-10-20  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* post.in (DEPLIBOBJNAMEFIX): New variable.
	(.depend): If $(STLIBOBJS) is non-empty, filter dependency info
	through $(DEPLIBOBJNAMEFIX).

2001-10-11  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* post.in: Minor tidying.  Make the target of the mondo recursion
	rule commands be the variable $(RECURSE_TARGETS).

2001-09-06  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* post.in (depfix2.sed): New target, generates a sed script
	that'll do a better job of identifying possible $(SRCTOP) uses.
	Collapse multiple slashes to one.  Uses new depgen.sed script.
	(.depend): Use it.

2001-09-01  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* post.in (.d): Run compiler as a separate target from sed
	processing.  Refuse to do anything if srcdir is ".".
	(.depend): Find a shortcut name for SRCTOP to eliminate "foo/.."
	subsequences, in case the compiler does the same.  Run depfix.sed
	after the directory-specific substitutions, not before.
	(depend-postrecurse): Renamed from old "depend" target.
	(depend, depend-prerecurse, depend-recurse): Make "depend"
	processing recursive.

2001-08-07  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@mit.edu>

	* post.in (all-recurse clean-recurse distclean-recurse
	install-recurse check-recurse Makefiles-recurse): Do not pass down
	CC and CCOPTS to subdirs. This causes automatic reconfiguration to
	fail with autoconf 2.52 where config.status is invoked with
	different environment variables.

2001-07024  Jeffrey Altman <jaltman@columbia.edu>

        * win-pre.in:  the proper #define is KRB5_DNS_LOOKUP_REALM

1999-03-31  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* post.in (Makefile): Don't try to run autoconf with $(SHELL),
		since this doesn't work if $(AUTOCONF) isn't a path to the
		built-in autoconf, but just an unqualified pathname to the
		system autoconf.  [krb5-build/707]

1999-02-19  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* windows.in (DLL_FILE_DEF): Add makefile controls to set either
		KRB5_DLL_FILE or GSS_DLL_FILE, with the default being
		KRB5_DLL_FILE.

Mon Feb  8 22:13:23 1999  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* winexclude.sed: Add .dll and .lib files to the list of functions
 		which shouldn't get included in the non-binary list of
 		files to be added to kerbsrc.zip for the Windows build.
		(If .dll or .lib files need to be included in the zip
 		file, they must be added to the WINBINARYFILES macro in
 		the top-level Makefile.in)

1998-11-13  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* post.in (*-recurse): If $(MY_SUBDIRS) is non-NULL use it instead
		of $(SUBDIRS) to control which directories are iterated
		over.  (This is needed so we can fold a directory's
		configure.in scripts into the parent's configure.in
		without having to move all of its siblings as well into
		the parent directory's configure.in.  This is because if
		the parent's configure.in file as a AC_CONFIG_DIRS macro,
		it gets included into all the $(SUBDIRS) macro of *all*
		of its generated makefiles, and this is wrong for all
		but the Makefile.in of the parent directory.  For example,
		if the configure.in in src/appl contains
		AC_CONFIG_DIRS(bsd telnet gssftp), and that configure
		script also generates the Makefile.in for src/appl/sample,
		then SUBDIRS will contain "bsd telnet gssftp" plus
		whatever LOCAL_SUBDIRS is defined to contain.  This
		doesn't work.  So instead of defining LOCAL_SUBDIRS,
		the Makefile.in in src/appl/sample defines MY_SUBDIRS,
		which completely overrides the SUBDIRS macro.
		Eventually, we should replace all of the LOCAL_SUBDIRS
		definitions in the Makefile.in's with MY_SUBDIRS, and
		add MY_SUBDIRS definitions into all Makefile.in's that
		don't currently have then, and depend on
		AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to insert the right magic value into
		SUBDIRS.  At that point, we can get rid of the SUBDIR
		definition in pre.in, and remove this test from
		post.in which tests of MY_SUBDIRS and uses it in
		preference to SUBDIRS, and simply always use MY_SUBDIRS.)

1998-05-27  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* windows.in: Remove -DLEHMAN, which doesn't do anything.  (A grep
		through the whole source tree shows no instances of #ifdef
		LEHMAN)

Sun May 24 21:39:49 1998  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* windows.in (ABS,S,C): Use double backslashes for the path
		separators to workaround Microsoft NMAKE brain damaging.
		Sometimes backslashes are treated as a quoting characters,
		and sometimes not, with no rhyme or reason that I can
		determine.  Fortunatelly double backslashes in pathanmes
		don't seem to hurt (for the times when the backslash isn't
		treated as a quoating character).  Whoever decided Windows
		should use backslash as a path separator should be shot.

Wed Apr 15 18:01:39 1998  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* pre.in (CRYPTO_DEPLIB):

	* pre.in: Define AUTOCONF and CONFIG_RELTOPDIR from the autoconf
 		substitution macros.

	* post.in: Fix the call to autoconf to use $(AUTOCONF) and
	 	$(CONFIG_RELTOPDIR), so that configure regeneration rule
	 	works even in a subdirectory below the configure script.

 		for Rhapsody DR1.

Mon Feb  2 17:02:29 1998  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* pre.in: SUBDIRS now also includes LOCAL_SUBDIRS, which is
		defined in the Makefile.in to control the recursive
		descent through the subdirectories.  This is used so
		that the subdirectories can be defined in Makefile.in,
		instead of in the individual configure.in files.

	        KRB5_BASE_DEPLBS)

Sat Mar  1 14:33:21 1997  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* libobj.in: Change .c.so and .c.po rules to work better with
	compilers that insist that $(CC) -fpic -c foo.c -o foo.so is

		timestamps of OBJS.* would not get checked after STAMP.* get
		updated, even though OBJS.* get updated as a side effect.
