 		the images are lined up correctly (at least using MIT's
 		dvips).

	 	postscript is built.  Add new target "clean-temp-ps" which
	 	cleans up the temporary postscript files.

		specific constructs, and replace with calls to expr.
		Since the arguments to "troff" require groff, just try to
		run groff explicitly (someone can always edit the ROFF and
		ROFF_OPTIONS at the top of the script).  Try to
		automatically detect whether csplit or gcsplit should be
		used, by grovelling through the user's path.

		magic doubleleft arrow hack.
