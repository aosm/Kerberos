[Ideas/ramblings not necessarily implying any future plans]

* Do we need to go back to using DebuggingLib?

* Remove LHierarchichyTable RemoveAllRows() override?

* Rename CTextColumnColorized?

* Why doesn't UpdateCollapsedWindowDockTile() work all the time?

* Remove FREF, BNDL resources from Mach-O version?

* Clean up 32 x 32 icon (less critical now that we've gone back to original icon on OS 9)

* Make sure things are using "small system font" as appropriate? (Doesn't seem to help the Japanese display issue...)

* why are we rolling our own CTextColumnColorized::DropInTrash as opposed to using LDragTask?

* Dragging a realm to the Trash does nothing (hence why are we wasting time supporting that?)

[Really old to-do items]
OPERATIONAL COMMENTS
--------------------
* Have KM quit after it's been launched by an AE to login, and the login is finished?

* Provide option to get tickets w/out IP addresses (if you're on DCHP for instance) to avoid problems with changing IP addresses - basically provide an interface for setting noaddresses = true.

* Should KM be reading and using default ticket options set in krb5conf?

CODE COMMENTS
-------------
* CTicketMgrApp::LaunchDateTime() - we return error codes but does anything actually ever look at them?

* Should we be launching the D&T control panel using OpenApplication() instead of AE (see Ticket Keeper launching code)?

* It's possible that we should check the time separator for our time displays, because for some languages it may not be a colon.

BUGS WE LIKELY CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT
--------------------------------------
* The last 0 if your ticket lifetime is 10:00 and your system font is Textile is getting clipped.  We have plenty of room in the text field, so this may be a PP right-justify bug (or OS bug).

* If you change system fonts in the Appearance dialog, a few text items in the main and login windows don't pick up the change (the ones that are right-justified and the active edit field).  This is apparently a PP bug.

* Windows don't make the Appearance sounds when they're moved.  This appears to be a PowerPlant bug.
