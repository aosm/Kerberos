      <p>Below the Active User box and Renew Tickets, Destroy Tickets, and Change 
        Password buttons is the <i>ticket list</i>. The ticket list shows all 
        the principals that are currently authenticated on the Macintosh.</p>
      <p>Each principal has a set of Kerberos tickets belonging to it. When you 
        log in with Kerberos, you get a <i>ticket-granting ticket</i> which then 
        allows you to get other tickets from other applications (also called services). 
        Then for each application you run that requires Kerberos authentication, 
        you get a <i>service ticket</i>.</p>
      <p>By default, the principals and their tickets appear as a summary line 
        in the ticket list. The summary lines are in bold text with a light gray 
        background. Each summary line has three elements:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Kerberos versions supported by the realm the principal is authenticated 
          in. This appears as &quot;(v4/v5)&quot;, &quot;(v4)&quot;, or &quot;(v5)&quot; 
          before the principal. When you log in using Kerberos for Macintosh, 
          it will attempt to get both Kerberos v4 and v5 tickets for your principal. 
          However, not all Kerberos-using sites support both versions, or different 
          realms at the same site may also support different versions, so you 
          may see only one version listed.</li>
        <li>The username of the authenticated principal.</li>
        <li>The minimum remaining lifetime for the ticket-granting tickets belonging 
          to the principal (displayed as hours:minutes). You receive one ticket-granting 
          ticket for each Kerberos version the realm supports; these may have 
          different expiration times (although Kerberos for Macintosh attempts 
          to make them the same).</li>
      </ul>
	  <p>Instead of a time, you may see either &quot;expired&quot; or &quot;not valid&quot; in the Time
		Remaining column.  &quot;Expired&quot; means that your tickets have no time remaining and
		so are no longer valid; &quot;not valid&quot; means they are no longer valid for some
		other reason, usually because your Mac's IP address has changed since you obtained
		the tickets.  In either case, you need to renew your tickets (although Kerberos for
		Macintosh will also prompt you automatically to renew if you try to use a service
		requiring Kerberos tickets).</p>
      <p>If you want to see details of tickets associated with each principal, 
        click on the triangle at the left of the principal's summary line. The 
        list will expand:</p>
      <p><img src="Graphics/krbmgr4.gif" alt="Expanded ticket list illustration"></p>
      <p>In the expanded list, you will see a list of the tickets (credentials) 
        belonging to that principal. If the principal is authenticated for both 
        versions of Kerberos, the tickets are grouped by version underneath a 
        subheading for each version (see picture above). For Kerberos v5 tickets, 
        an &quot;(F)&quot; after the ticket name means the ticket is forwardable, 
        a &quot;(P)&quot; means the ticket is proxiable, and &quot;(F,P)&quot; 
        means the ticket is both forwardable and proxiable (see <a href="#prefs">Changing 
        preferences</a> for more information about forwardable and proxiable).</p>
      <p>If you always want the ticket list to display expanded entries, you can 
        set the &quot;Always expand new ticket list entries&quot; preference. 
        See the <a href="#prefs">Changing preferences</a> section.</p>
      <p>You can display even more detailed information about each ticket using 
        the Ticket Info window. See the <a href="#ticketinfo">Displaying ticket 
        information</a> section.</p>

      <P>A default Kerberos realm is specified by the Kerberos Preferences file 
        (as distributed from MIT, this realm is ATHENA.MIT.EDU). When using the 
        Kerberos control panel to log in, by default the Kerberos username and 
        password entered are checked for authorization in this area of the network. 
        You can add other realms, as described in this section, and change which 
        one Kerberos Login uses by default. (For instructions on how to change 
        the default realm, see <A HREF="#prefs">Changing Preferences</A>.) 
      <P>Other realms listed in the Kerberos Preferences file can also be used 
        for logging in, but must first be added to the list of &quot;favorite&quot; 
        realms which are displayed in the Kerberos Login dialog. The Kerberos 
        control panel has a feature called Edit Favorite Realms that provides 
        the following options for making the other realms in Kerberos Preferences 
        available for use: 
      <UL>
        <LI>You can add one or multiple realms from the Kerberos Preferences file 
          to the Favorite Realms List.

        <LI>If you want to keep the list of Favorite realms to the minimum that 
          you need, you can remove realms from the Favorite Realms List.</LI>
      </UL>
      <P>Although other realms may exist besides the ones through the Edit Favorite 
        Realms feature, you can only add or remove realms listed in the Kerberos 
        Preferences file. (For information on adding new realms to the Kerberos
        preferences file, see the <A HREF="http://web.mit.edu/macdev/Development/MITKerberos/Common/Documentation/preferences.html">Kerberos Preferences Documentation</A>.

            <li><strong>Floating Window</strong>: 
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Show floating window</strong> (default = off): If 
                  this box is checked, the Kerberos Floating Window will be displayed.</li>
                <li><strong>Floating window can be closed</strong> (default = 
                  on): If this box is checked, the Kerberos Floating Window has a close 
                  box and can be closed. (You'll have to use the &quot;show floating 
                  window&quot; preference or tear the menu off the Kerberos Menu/Control Strip
                  to display it again.) Note that unlike  in old versions of KClient,
                  closing the floating window does not destroy any tickets, it simply
                  hides the floating window.</li>
                <li><strong>Show commands in floating window</strong> (default 
                  = off): The Kerberos Floating Window has two states, a simple compact 
                  state where only the usernames of the currently authenticated 
                  users are displayed, or an expanded state where Get Ticket, 
                  Destroy Tickets, and Renew Tickets commands are displayed along 
                  with the authenticated users. If this box is checked, the floating window 
                  is displayed in its expanded state with the commands. You can 
                  also switch between the compact and expanded states of the floating window 
                  by clicking on the zoom box in the floating window's title bar.</li>
                <li><strong>Show remaining lifetime &quot;pie&quot; in floating 
                  window</strong> (default = on): If this box is checked, a small 
                  circle indicating the relative amount of time remaining until 
                  the user's tickets expire is displayed next to each authenticated 
                  user's name.</li>

              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Lifetimes</strong>: 
              <ul>
                <li>Using the edit fields in this preferences panel, you can set 
                  the minimum and maximum range of the ticket lifetime slider 
                  displayed by the Kerberos Login dialog. You can also set the default 
                  ticket lifetime (this is the same as the &quot;ticket lifetime 
                  always&quot; option in the Login Defaults preferences). These 
                  settings only control the minimum and maximum lifetimes your 
                  Macintosh requests from the Kerberos server; the Kerberos server 
                  may not allow tickets longer or shorter than certain lifetimes. 
                  (Defaults are 0:10:00 minimum, 10:00:00 maximum, and 10:00:00 
                  default.) </li>
