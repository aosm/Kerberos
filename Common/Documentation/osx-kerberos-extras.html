<P>If you have just upgraded from Mac OS X 10.2 to Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther), you must download
and install a new copy of the Kerberos Extras.  Kerberos Extras that were installed before July 2003
are not compatible with Mac OS X 10.3.  If in doubt, download a new copy and reinstall.</P>

<P>You can tell if you have the latest version of the Kerberos Extras the following ways:
the installer's read me says "Rev 12" in the first line, and if you perform <B>Get Info</B> on the
CFM support file <CODE>/System/Library/CFMSupport/Kerberos</CODE> , the version number will be 4.2.</P>

<P><B>What is Mac OS X Kerberos Extras?</B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
While Mac OS X 10.2 (Jaguar) and Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther) ship with most parts of Kerberos for Macintosh, they
do not include support for CFM-based Kerberos-using applications (such as Eudora and Fetch), and the
GUI Kerberos management application is in a hard-to-find location.
</P>

<P>
The Mac OS X Kerberos Extras installer will install the Kerberos CFM support library and
make an alias to the GUI Kerberos Management application in <code>/Applications/Utilities</code>
(the Kerberos application ships in <CODE>/System/Library/CoreSevices</CODE> ).  By default the installer will
also install a sample configuration file (<CODE>edu.mit.Kerberos</CODE>) if one does not already exist, or
you can choose a custom install to force install a new (MIT-based) configuration file.
</P>
<P>
If you have just upgraded from an older Mac OS X to a newer version (such as from Mac OS X 10.1 to 10.2, or 10.2 to 10.3),
you <B>must</B> install the latest Mac OS X Kerberos Extras even if you had Eudora and/or Fetch working previously.
</P>

<P>
However, the current release is compatible with both Mac OS X 10.3 and 10.2.
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
You can download the Mac OS X Kerberos Extras installer, Rev 12,
from <a href="http://web.mit.edu/macdev/Download/Mac_OS_X_Kerberos_Extras.dmg">here</A> (disk image, 715KB, contains no crypto code).

<P><B>Important Note for Eudora Users</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>There is an issue with one of the Eudora 5.1.1 plug-ins that causes Eudora to fail to launch
  after you've installed the Mac OS X Kerberos Extras.  The best way to fix this is to upgrade to Eudora 5.2 or later.
  
  <P>However, if you cannot upgrade to Eudora 5.2 or later, you can do the following:
  in the Finder, bring up the 
  Finder contextual menu by control-clicking on the Eudora application icon and select "Show Package Contents".
  When the window pops up with the Contents folders in it,  navigate to the Eudora Stuff folder:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
   <P><CODE>Contents -> MacOS -> Eudora Stuff</CODE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
   
   <P>and remove the <CODE>UPPERlower Carbon</CODE> plug-in (drag it to the desktop or some other storage place).
   Close up the Eudora contents window and try again, Eudora should now work.  Removing this plug-in removes the
   ability to change the selected text to all lowercase, all uppercase, etc. from the Edit menu in Eudora.  This
   bug will be fixed in a future release of Eudora.

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+2">Mac OS X 10.1 Kerberos Extras</FONT></B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Important</B>:  In most cases, you should not use the Mac OS X 10.1 Extras installer.  It is not compatible
with Mac OS X 10.2 or later (use the Mac OS X 10.2 Kerberos Extras, see above), and has been superseded by
Kerberos for Macintosh 4.0.x on Mac OS X 10.1.  It is still provided for certain special circumstances only
(see below).

<P><B>What is Mac OS X 10.1 Kerberos Extras?</B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
While Mac OS X 10.1 as shipped includes Kerberos support in the form of a Mach-O framework and command line utilities,
it does not include support for CFM-based Kerberos-using applications (such as Eudora and Fetch) nor a GUI
Kerberos management application.
</P>

<P>
The Mac OS X 10.1 Kerberos Extras installer was created to install both CFM support bridge libraries and
the GUI Kerberos management application to the built-in Kerberos of Mac OS X 10.1.  However, both the
Kerberos in Mac OS X 10.1 and the Kerberos Extras have been superseded by the full final release of
Kerberos for Macintosh 4.0.3, which includes updated base components as well as the CFM bridge libraries and
the GUI Kerberos management application, and we recommend that you install <A HREF="release-4.0.3.html">Kerberos for Macintosh 4.0.3</A> instead
of the Mac OS X 10.1 Kerberos Extras.
</P>

<P>
However, Kerberos for Macintosh 4.0.3 is not available for download outside of North America, whereas the
Mac OS X 10.1 Kerberos Extras are, so the Kerberos Extras remain available for those users.</P>

<P>
The Mac OS X 10.1 Kerberos Extras installer will add both CFM support bridge libraries and
the GUI Kerberos Management application to the built-in Kerberos of Mac OS X 10.1.  The components installed
are equivalent to those included with Kerberos for Macintosh 4.0a19. The Mac OS X 10.1 Kerberos Extras installer
will also install a sample preferences file (<CODE>edu.mit.Kerberos</CODE>) if one does not already exist.
